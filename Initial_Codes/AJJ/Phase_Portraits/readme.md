Model and ODEs from 2-sites AJJ  paper -

- For $\phi = 0, \pi$ and $z=0$, it is a stable point, does not evolve with time.
- For $\phi = 0, \pi$, and any other non-zero and bounded between $1$ and $-1$, both the variables evolve with time. Their phase-portraits are horizontal ellipses and get distorted for large $z$ values and constant $\phi$.
- Direction of the curves is clockwise

* For $\phi$ values excluding multiples of ${0, \pi}$ and any value of $z$, not stationary point and their phase-portraits are vertical ellipses which get distorted for large $z$ values and constant $\phi$.
* Direction of the curves is anti-clockwise
